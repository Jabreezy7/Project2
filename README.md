# Sokoban Game ðŸŽ®

## Description
This isnâ€™t just any gameâ€”this is a tribute to the timeless Sokoban puzzle! This classic 2D puzzle game challenges you to push boxes onto designated target squares, all while navigating a maze that tests your strategic thinking and problem-solving skills.

This project was created for my CS447 Computer Organization and Assembly Course, where I had the amazing opportunity to dive deep into the intricacies of game design and the assembly language programming. 

In this demo video level 1 took me 38 moves to completeâ€”see if you can solve it in fewer moves! ðŸ§©

## Getting Started

Ready to dive in? Hereâ€™s how you can get started with the Sokoban Game!

### Installing and Running MARS MIPS
MARS (MIPS Assembler and Runtime Simulator) is a Java-based tool that allows you to assemble, simulate, and debug MIPS assembly language programs. 

Follow the steps below to install and run MARS MIPS on your system:

0. (Prerequisite) - Ensure that you have Java installed on your machine. MARS requires Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 1.8 or later.
1. Click on this link to download MARS: https://github.com/dpetersanderson/MARS/releases/download/v.4.5.1/Mars4_5.jar
2. Once you have downloaded the MARS .jar file, Open your terminal (Linux or macOS) or Command Prompt (Windows).
3. Navigate to the directory where the MARS_*.jar file is located.
4. Run the following command:
```bash
java -jar MARS_*.jar

```

### Game Usage

Once you have MARS MIPS installed you can clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Jabreezy7/sokoban-game.git
```

## Follow these final steps to set up and launch the game:
1. Click on file in the MARS header section and open up the "game.asm" file
2. Now Press on tools in the MARS header section and select the "Keypad and LED Display Simulator" Option
3. Once the LED Display pops up press on the "Connect to MIPS" button on the bottom of the display
4. Click on the wrench and screwdriver icon to Assemble the current file
5. Finally, click on the green play button icon (the one without the "1" superscript) in the MARS header section and enjoy!
