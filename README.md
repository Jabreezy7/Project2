# Sokoban Game ðŸŽ®

## Description
This isnâ€™t just any gameâ€”this is a tribute to the timeless Sokoban puzzle! This classic 2D puzzle game challenges you to push boxes onto designated target squares, all while navigating a maze that tests your strategic thinking and problem-solving skills.

This project was created for my CS447 Computer Organization and Assembly Course, where I had the amazing opportunity to dive deep into the intricacies of game design and the assembly language programming. 

In this demo video level 1 took me 38 moves to completeâ€”see if you can solve it in fewer moves! ðŸ§©

## Getting Started

Ready to dive in? Hereâ€™s how you can get started with the Sokoban Game!

### Installing and Running MARS MIPS
MARS (MIPS Assembler and Runtime Simulator) is a Java-based tool that allows you to assemble, simulate, and debug MIPS assembly language programs. 

Follow the steps below to install and run MARS MIPS on your system:

0. (Prerequisite) - Ensure that you have Java installed on your machine. MARS requires Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 1.8 or later.
1. Click on this link to download MARS: https://github.com/dpetersanderson/MARS/releases/download/v.4.5.1/Mars4_5.jar
2. Once you have downloaded the MARS .jar file, Open your terminal (Linux or macOS) or Command Prompt (Windows).
3. Navigate to the directory where the MARS_*.jar file is located.
4. Run the following command:
```bash
java -jar MARS_*.jar

```

### Game Usage

Once you have MARS MIPS installed you can clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Jabreezy7/sokoban-game.git
```

## Follow these final steps to set up and launch the game:
1. In MARS, click on **File** in the header section and open the `game.asm` file from the repository.
2. Next, click on **Tools** in the MARS header section and select **Keypad and LED Display Simulator**.
3. When the LED Display pops up, click on the **Connect to MIPS** button at the bottom of the display.
4. Assemble the file by clicking on the **wrench and screwdriver** icon in the MARS toolbar.
5. Finally, click on the **green play button** (the one without the "1" superscript) to run the game.

Enjoy the Sokoban challenge!
